                <p class="bio">
                    With utmost humility and a deep sense of responsibility, I present myself to serve the men, women and children of Chanchaga Federal Constituency as a Member House of the Representatives in the 2023 – 2027 legislative term. I draw inspiration and guidance from God Almighty and my energy comes from your manifest love and unwavering support since I joined active politics in 2007. You have been part of our collective aspiration in my two previous attempts in 2007 and 2015, respectively. On both occasions, God had decreed that it was not yet the right time, but you kept alive your faith and confidence in me, thereby making it possible to keep the flame of my passion alive. In this Compact with the People of Chanchaga Federal Constituency of Niger State, I reaffirm my commitment to represent you in the 10th Assembly with character, competence and compassion.

                <h5>My Four-Point Agenda and Covenant with the People of Chanchaga</h5>

                <p class="bio">
                    As a Member representing Chanchaga Federal Constituency, my principle and practice will be firmly anchored on true representation in which my role will be that of a compliant emissary of my people and a vehement advocate for their rights, privileges, and overall wellbeing. With close to two decades of experience in politics and public service, I have gained a profound understanding of the developmental challenges bedeviling my immediate constituency, Niger State and Nigeria. These intractable maladies range from youth unemployment and overdependence on limited public sector jobs; absent or erratic provision of essential services and critical infrastructure; dwindling public revenues and weak financial management; low-capacity utilization in agriculture, industry and other productive sectors of the economy; to pervasive and worsening poverty and a general decline in the quality of life of the average citizen. 
                </p>
                <p class="bio">
                    Resolving these longstanding obstacles to our collective progress requires the legislature to enact appropriate and futuristic laws and amend or repeal obsolete ones, represent the true interests of the people, provide oversight without fear or favour, safeguard public finances with integrity and give voice for citizens to air their grievances and seek redress. These are the core legislative functions, and it is from them that I derive my four-point agenda, namely:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Ensuring effective, real time and people powered representation for Chanchaga
                    </li>
                    <li class="pt-2">
                        Driving progressive and human centred legislative enactments to strengthen governance
                    </li>
                    <li class="pt-2">
                        Exacting the highest level of probity and accountability in governance from the executive arm
                    </li>
                    <li class="pt-2">
                        Providing quality and equitable constituency services to empower the people and improve wellbeing.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p class="bio">
                    <i><b>Ensuring effective, real time and people powered representation</b></i>
                </p>
                <p class="bio">
                    Normally, in a representative democracy the will of the people is suprême and must be consulted and accommodated in the lawmaking process and in all other parliamentary duties. In reality, however, this basic requirement of lawmakers has become a matter of privilege to the extent that some parliamentarians do not mainatain functional contituency offices. As a member representing Chanchaga Federal Constituency, I am determined to reverse this undemocratic trend by reviving the representational role of a legislator through the following activities:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I will be a strong avocate for the views, interests and needs of the people of Chanchaga within the broader national interest. 
                    </li>
                    <li class="pt-2">
                        I will run a fully functioning constituency office that will be open to all my constituents five-days-a-week on a walk-in basis and with no appointment required.
                    </li>
                    <li class="pt-2">
                        I will run a round-the-clock call centre through which my constituents can reach me with complaints, suggestions and requests, to be complemented with a hotline for constituents to communicate directly to me in emergencies.
                    </li>
                    <li class="pt-2">
                        I will organize a biweekly meet-the-people sessions to interface directly with individual constituents, listen to and resolve their problems as much as possible and offer appropriate advice where applicable.
                    </li>
                    <li class="pt-2">
                        I will organize quarterly town hall meetings to listen to issues of interest to the people of Chanchaga and to discuss specific upcoming legislation and to ensure that the people’s diverse interests are aggregated and articulated into the policy process
                    </li>
                    <li class="pt-2">
                        My team and I will analyze the provisions of every proposed legislation for its potential impact on the people of Chanchaga and Niger State. Similarly, the views and interests of my immediate constituents will be uppermost in my mind when considering any new legislation or the effects of implementing existing law.
                    </li>
                    <li class="pt-2">
                        I will regularly create public awareness of federal government policies, programmes and projects, including drawing the attention of the people of Niger State and Nigeria.
                    </li>

                    Singly and in collaboration with other parliamentary colleagues, I will develop and debate motions and bills to represent and advance the interests of Chanchaga Federal Constituency, Niger State and Nigeria and this will be done with human face. This will be accomplished by continuously monitoring and researching local, national, and international developments or problems that may require legislative action and proposing or supporting motions or bills to addresses them. 
                </p>

                <p class="bio">
                    I will actively participate in all committee and subcommittee activities to which I will be assigned, ensuring proper awareness of all policy issues that are presented at committee level or in the plenary, including its implication for Chanchaga Federal constituency, Niger State and Nigeria. I will initiate amendments to obsolete or problematic laws and exercise my parliamentary vote with clear conscience and only in the interest of my immediate constituents. Similarly, I commit to informed and active participation in all floor debates on pertaining to matters of importance to the people of Chanchaga and Niger State and whenever matters reported from my parliamentary committees are under consideration.
                </p>

                <p class="bio">
                    I will engage a capable and committed team of Legislative Assistants to research issues of greatest importance to Chanchaga Federal Constituency and Niger State and come up with draft legislative instruments which I will present for parliamentary consideration and action.
                </p>

                    In themselves, laws and policies do not guarantee good governance and societal progress no matter how sound or well-intentioned they turn ut to be. Moreover, both anecdotal and emperical evidence have shown that Nigeria’s delayed developmental milesones stem not so much from the absence of sound laws and policies, but from lack of diligent policy implementation and follow through. To this extent, the parliamentary function of ensuring that enacted laws are administered according to their intent and that citizens are regularly provided with verifiable evidence of the success of public policies has become more paramount in today’s Nigeria. A substantial part of my time and talent as a Member representing Chanchaga Federal Constituency in the National Assembly will be devoted to diligent oversight and investigation of the executive branch of government. 
                </p>

                <p class="bio">
                    To promote and enforce efficiency, transparency and accountability in the running of government business, I will stridently and without fear or favour insist on periodic and proper monitoring and supervision of ministries, departments, agencies (MDAs) and parastatals, including thorough reviews of their programmes, activities and policy implementation. Where necessary, I will actively sponsor and participate in proceedings to question leaders of the executive and their appointees and officials, and in reporting constituents’ experiences with particular programs or agencies of government or private sector entities. Specifically, my oversight activities in the House of Representatives will focus on the following: 
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Identification and prevention of inefficiency and waste in government programmes and projects arising from extravagance, fraud, and misuse of public funds.</li>
